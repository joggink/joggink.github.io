I"C<p>Remember the days we used to put a static image of a roadmap on a website, usually accompanied by silly directions in case you came from the North, South or Mars? It was only some time later, when the web matured and google stopped being just a search engine, that a new corporate ‘how to get here / where are we located’ toy was born. Google invented google maps, pretty soon yahoo followed and Microsoft, well… they tend to do everything the rest does, it only takes them a little longer.

Forget yahoo and bing! maps, only if your a fanboy you’ll use them and even then you’re not sure how long they will be around (- cf. yahoo &amp; geocities). Google maps was and is the way to go. Every post-iPhone smartphone has google maps (except the windows phones who use a mediocre version called bing maps).</p>
